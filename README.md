# Terra Gallery aims to be nft gallery for the terra ecosystem

The intention behind this project was to build it in my spare time, to have a place where the comunity could see all their nft and interact with it,  but after the luna crash and because we still know little about what is going to happen after that its been paused. I may add more to it when terra 2 activates. 

you can see the project running in https://terragallery.xyz its designed to work for mobile first (the plan is to make it responsive later) so it may look weird in desktop (huge nfts). 

to run it 

clone the repo

`npm i` o `yarn` 

`npm run start` o `yarn start`

browse localhost:3000

If you have a terra wallet and terra station with nfts you will be able to connect it with the app, if you don't you can use the button "view an address", and paste 
`terra1e4sldk08xfm033qx4y090afzpptc6e5k5mg6h9` to see how it works. 

# this repo is based on the template

TODO: 
- add more contracts (and serialize existing ones, there is no standard)
- add more details on the nft
- Enable transfer button
