# Terra Gallery aims to be nft gallery for the terra ecosystem
(development paused) 

This project is a sideproject I had, the intention was to build it in my spare time but after the luna crash its been paused.

you can see the project running in terragallery.xyz its designed to be mobile (and the desktop part is not done yet) so it may look weird in desktop. 

to run it 
clone the repo
`npm i` o `yarn` 
`npm run start` o `yarn start`
browse localhost:3000
if you have a terra wallet with nfts you can use it to connect the app, if you dont you can use this wallet in the button "view an address"
